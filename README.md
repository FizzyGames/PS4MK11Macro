# PS4MK11Macro
A macro for Mortal Kombat 11 that automatically runs towers using PS4Macro and PS4 Remote Play.

# Setup
* Install and set up PS4 remote play from the official site https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/en/index.html.
* Download and unzip the wonderful PS4Macro from here: https://github.com/komefai/PS4Macro.
* Download the latest release of this plugin from the releases page (or build it from source).
* Run the PS4 remote play app, then run PS4Macro.
* On PS4Macro, click File>Open and then open the MK11Macro DLL.
* Ensure that your gamma setting in MK11 is set to 50 (default).
* Set up your first slot on Noob Saibot to be AI-friendly (i.e. 30 kombos, 30 reversal, combo-friendly abilities).
* Navigate to the Klassic Towers, then hover over the Survivor Tower.
* Click the play button on PS4Macro.
* Do whatever while the bot runs the survivor tower over and over again.

Notes:
You may need to turn on controller emulation if you want to use a ps4 controller on the PC running this, or if you don't have a ps4 controller handy; refer to the documentation on "EmulateController" on the PS4Macro repository for how to do so.
